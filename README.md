# CardDrawDeath
A test idea of a card game idea I had.
It's heavily inspired off of Exploding Kittens the card game.

So, the concept is simple.
If you draw the last card in the deck, you die.

Here's the basic game rules:

1) You start the game by drawing X cards. This is your hand.
2) On your turn, you may play as many cards as you want.
2.5) Played cards go into the discard pile.
3) When you end your turn, you must draw one card.
4) If you draw the last card in the deck, you are eliminated.
5) When someone is eliminated, the discarded pile is shuffled back in.
6) Repeat from 2 until there is only one person left.

That's it! The interesting part now is the cards.
Here are some ideas for the cards:

MILL X - Name taken from MTG. Put X cards from the deck into the discard.
DRAW X - Self explanitory. Target player draws X cards.
    (should you be able to target yourself? Or would that be too powerful?)
SKIP X - Can be played anytime you are to draw cards. You can skip drawing X cards.
